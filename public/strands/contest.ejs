            When asked to describe the impact which the Turniptacular Children's Art Competition had on her career, renowned batik artist and former winner Bernadette Madden said "A wonderful childhood experience. A magical memory. Children's Art sowed a seed (pun intended) which encouraged me to develop my artistic talents at a very young age. Thank you Turniptacular".
          </p>    
          <p>
            With an annual entry of up to 50,000 paintings, the Turniptacular Children's Art Competition is one that has touched the lives of virtually every family in Ireland at some time or another throughout its 20 year lifetime. In that respect alone, it is quite special.
          </p>
