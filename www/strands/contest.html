            When asked to describe the impact which the Turniptacular Children's Art Competition had on her career, renowned batik artist and former winner Bernadette Madden said "A wonderful childhood experience. A magical memory. Children's Art sowed a seed (pun intended) which encouraged me to develop my artistic talents at a very young age. Thank you Turniptacular".
          </p>    
          <p>
            With an annual entry of up to 50,000 paintings, the Turniptacular Children's Art Competition is one that has touched the lives of virtually every family in Ireland at some time or another throughout its 20 year lifetime. In that respect alone, it is quite special.

      Poem of The Week<br>
      by<br>
      Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Finney had a turnip,<br>
      And it grew, and it grew,<br>
      And it grew behind the barn,<br>
      And the turnip did no harm.<br>
    </p>  
    <p>
      And it grew, and it grew,<br>
      Till it could grow no taller;<br>
      Then Mr. Finney took it up<br>
      And put it in the cellar.<br>
    </p>  
    <p>
      There it lay, there it lay,<br>
      Till it began to rot;<br> 
      When his daughter Susie washed it<br>
      And put it in the pot.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she boiled it and boiled it,<br>
      As long as she was able;<br>
      Then his daughter Susie took it<br>
      And put it on the table.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Finney and his wife<br>
      Both sat down to sup;<br>
      And they ate, and they ate,<br>
      Until they ate the turnip up.<br>
