            Turnip is a type of root vegetables that belongs to the mustard/cabbage family. It originates from Europe. Turnip was created through the process of selective breeding of wild turnip. There are 30 domesticated varieties of turnip that can be found around the world today. Turnip grows in areas with cold climate, on fertile, well-drained soil, exposed to direct sunlight. People cultivate turnip as a source of food.

      Poem of The Week<br>
      by<br>
      Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Finney had a turnip,<br>
      And it grew, and it grew,<br>
      And it grew behind the barn,<br>
      And the turnip did no harm.<br>
    </p>  
    <p>
      And it grew, and it grew,<br>
      Till it could grow no taller;<br>
      Then Mr. Finney took it up<br>
      And put it in the cellar.<br>
    </p>  
    <p>
      There it lay, there it lay,<br>
      Till it began to rot;<br> 
      When his daughter Susie washed it<br>
      And put it in the pot.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she boiled it and boiled it,<br>
      As long as she was able;<br>
      Then his daughter Susie took it<br>
      And put it on the table.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Finney and his wife<br>
      Both sat down to sup;<br>
      And they ate, and they ate,<br>
      Until they ate the turnip up.<br>
